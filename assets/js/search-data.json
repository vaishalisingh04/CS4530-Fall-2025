    "content": "Our policy on use of AI can be found below: . For IP1, IP2, and Activities: . The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools is forbidden, subject to the following: . | The use of auto-complete tools that suggest the next line or few lines of your code, is permitted. The use of these tools saves you typing, without much impact on your learning experience. | The use of tools that take natural-language input and generate code is forbidden. This includes tools like Chat GPT, Cursor, AugmentCode, etc. It also includes Chat modes in VSC and “/” commands in CoPilot. | . You may use LLM-based tools like ChatGPT or Claude as shortcuts in situations where you might use Google Search, Stack Overflow, etc, for learning purposes only. You may never copy-paste code produced by online resources. Remember: The basic policy is that you are responsible for the code you submit. We reserve the right to interview you orally to make sure that you understand everything in your submission. For the Team Project: . The following policy is a draft. We solicit feedback from students who have already used AI tools in their programming. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools is permitted, subject to the following: . | The basic policy is that you are responsible for the code you contribute to the project, and you are responsible for the code you review in the project. Telling a groupmate or course staff member “I don’t know, it’s what the AI produced” or “I don’t know, the AI said it made sense” is not in line with the minimal expectations of the course, and repeatedly failing to be accountable for the code you write or the code reviews you sign off on will result in failing the course. We reserve the right to interview you orally to make sure that you understand everything in your submission. | Each team should have a common policy about the use of AI in their project. It is not fair for one team member to be using AI, and the others not (or vice versa). Your team policy should take into account the relative experiences of the team members with AI coding tools. | You will still have to debug your code and tests. These models are trained mostly on code that works, so they are generally bad at debugging code they have never seen before. If you don’t understand the code, then you will not be able to debug it, nor will your TA be able to help you. | Any monetary costs associated with these tools are to be borne by the student (sorry). We encourage students to share information about available student discounts. | Do your own reflections, assessments, and reports. The point of reflections is what happens in your brain, not in producing text that course staff gets to read. | . If you do use such a tool, here are a few suggestions: . | Don’t ask to go far beyond what you can review and understand as you go. Remember, you are ultimately responsible for the code | “Vibe” coding, in which the AI writes large chunks of code without supervision, is strongly discouraged. (see bullet above about your personal responsibility for the code). | Beware letting the chatbot lead you on wild goose chases if the first or second suggestion doesn’t nail the problem. | Treat it like a very junior (but over-eager) engineer, who needs constant supervision and frequent correction. | Use rules (like .cursorrules) to set the ground rules for the AI. There are lots of sources for useful sets of rules. We encourage you to share such rulesets, both within your team and with other students in the course. (And with the course staff: we want to learn, too!) | . ",

    "doc": "Debugging",
    "title": "Debugging",
    "content": "One of the objectives of this class is to provide students with experiences writing new code for large, existing codebases. We anticipate that you may run into difficulties debugging the project code: it is often difficult to build debugging skills until you have a problem in front of you that requires them. The course staff is happy to help you with debugging, with the specific goal of helping you learn to successfully apply scientific debugging. Andreas Zeller’s Debugging Book provides an excellent guide to scientific debugging. The short version is roughly: if you can’t debug an issue in the first few minutes “just by looking at it”, it will be hard to keep all of the relevant information in your head at once, and a formal process to help you generate and refine guesses for why something is wrong can be immensely useful. The key idea is to create a debugging note file, where you track information like: . | What was the input/application state that caused the bug? | What was the behavior that I expected? | What was the behavior that I observed? | What are possible hypotheses for that behavior? | How have I tested those hypotheses, and what was the result? | . The overall goal with hypothesis formulation is to come up with possible causes for why the bug exists. Then, as long as those hypotheses are testable, we can prove or disprove them. Most hypotheses will be along the lines of “did I make an incorrect assumption about how a library or API works.” The devil is in enumerating all of the possible incorrect assumptions that you might have made, and testing them. The best way to attack these kinds of problems is to start with testing some high-level, general assumptions, and then refine them. If you come to us for debugging help, we will ask you to answer these 5 questions, as our goal is to help you get better at debugging and not to simply point out bugs that we might have seen before. We are happy to discuss the problematic behavior that you are observing, possible hypotheses for why that behavior is occurring, and strategies to test those hypotheses. In the past, students have found that using a variety of strategies to test their hypotheses (e.g. using a debugger, creating a minimized test case, measured application of console.log statements, internet research) are useful, and we would be happy to demonstrate these. We may not be able to stay with you while you work on refining your hypotheses and fixing the bug, but would be happy to continue following up if you get stuck again. ",

    "content": "Building, delivering and maintaining successful software products requires more than being good at programming. Software engineering encompasses the tools and processes that we use to design, construct and maintain programs over time. Software engineering has been said to consider the “multi person development of multi version programs.” Development processes that work well for a single developer do not scale to large or even medium-sized teams. Similarly, development processes that work well for quickly delivering a one-off program to a client cause chaos when applied to a codebase that needs to be maintained and updated over months and years. This class will begin to explore these tradeoffs throughout the entire software development lifecycle, with a particular focus on how these decisions affect the quality of the resulting software. This class will serve as an introduction to the field of software engineering, covering key topics such as: . | Requirements gathering and specification How to make sure that you build the product that your customer really wants | Designing code for reuse, for readability, and for scale How to avoid reinventing the wheel? What makes code readable? Where does performance fit into designs? When do we decide when to revisit old design decisions, and how do we replace them? Can we avoid the mistakes that past developers have made? | How to organize your development process to collaborate effectively How do we communicate our designs with others? How do we structure and coordinate development activities? How do we measure the performance of these processes, and tweak them over time? | How to ensure that your code works, is secure, and broadly speaking, “does the right thing” How do we measure different quality attributes like usability, scalability and performance? How do we minimize the cost of defects? How do we automatically test complex systems? Can we automatically prove the absence of some kinds of defects? | . ",

At the end of the semester, the instructors and TAs will evaluate all of the student projects, and select the best (in terms of usability, code quality, test suite quality, and overall design) to showcase on course website. The project will provide hands-on experience to complement the skills taught in this class, requiring students to be able to: . | Work effectively in a small team | Enumerate and prioritize development tasks | Propose, design, implement and test new feature(s) in an existing non-toy software application | Write code that their team members can read and review | Review teammates’ code | Analyze a proposed software architecture | Use relevant software tools, such as: . | TypeScript | React | Visual Studio Code (or similar IDE) | Git | Jest | Postman | . | .

Summary of Project Grading . Your overall project grade (which will account for 40% of your final grade in this course) will be the weighted average of each of the deliverables. | Planning (20%) . | This includes the Preliminary Project Plan and the Revised Project Plan. | . | Process (20%) . | This includes: use of a structured development process, including regular git commits, pull requests, code reviews, timely completion of progress reports and individual/team surveys, and weekly meetings with TA Mentor. | This also includes appropriate division of labor within the project (i.e., roughly equal). For full credit, each member of the team must have at least 2 commits during the each sprint (even when using pair programming). | . | Product (40%) . | 20% Successful delivery of your Minimum Viable Product as defined in your project plan | 10% Desirable delivered features | 10% Test suite of your features. | . | Reports (20%) . | 10% Final Report | 10% Poster and Demo | . | Individual Reflection (required to receive an ‘A’) | . In cases where team members do not equally contribute to the project, we may assign different grades to different individuals, up to an extreme of deducting 50% of the team project grade for a student (which might arise to 100% deduction for not contributing to the project at all). We will evaluate each individual’s contribution on the basis of a variety of factors, including progress reports at weekly meetings, through inspecting version control history, through each students’ self-reflection, and through each students’ peer evaluations (during and/or at the end of the project). We will make regular efforts to collect and distribute this feedback throughout the project — our ultimate goal is for all students to participate and receive full marks. Team Formation . All projects will be completed in a team of 3-4 students. The very first deliverable for the project will be a self assessment and team preference survey: you will be able to indicate your preferences for teammates. The instructors will assign students to the teams based on a number of factors including your responses to the survey and diversity of skills for the teammates. All students in each team MUST be in the same section of the class. Team Meetings with TA Mentor . Each team will be assigned a TA to act as a mentor, who will work closely with you for the entire project and also will serve as your point of contact for project questions and grading. During Week 5, you will arrange a “Kickoff Meeting” with your TA mentor, where you will meet your TA mentor and have the opportunity to share any early ideas that you might want feedback on before submitting the your preliminary project plan. Once project begins in full force, you will have weekly meetings with your TA mentor (scheduled at your team’s and the TA’s convenience) in order to help ensure that you are making progress on the project, and to help address problems that you encounter (be they technical or non-technical problems). Weekly meetings will often include review of your pull requests, github commits, code reviews and demos from each group. Preliminary Project Plan . All projects will involve frontend and backend development of new features for FakeStackoverflow. Once teams have been formed, you and your team will decide what kind of new features you would like to build. Your features should be something that can be implemented within the timeframe allotted (5-7 weeks), and will be implemented in a fork of the main codebase. Given that you will be up-to-speed on the project codebase (and have been introduced to TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and testing frameworks), and that you will have a team of three or four, we expect that the feature that you propose will be more complex than the feature implemented in the individual projects. The project plan will focus on two sections: . | User stories and conditions of satisfaction that describe the features that you plan to implement. Each Condition of Satisfaction is prioritized (Priorities are: Essential, Desirable, or Extension). The set of essential items will constitute the “Minimum Viable Product” discussed above. Teams are responsible for all essential and desirable work. | Work breakdown: Map your user stories to engineering tasks. Assign each task to a team member (or pair of team members), provide an estimate for how long each task will take, a brief rationale for that estimate, and schedule those stories into sprints. | . Creating a GitHub Repository . Your team’s development must take place within a GitHub repository in our GitHub Classroom. This repository will be private, and visible only to your team and the course staff. After the semester ends, you are welcome to make it public - you will have complete administrative control of the repository. We will provide instructions to set up these repositories for all groups and will also provide the starter code for the project (after the revised project plans are submitted). Revised Project Plan . Based on the feedback that you receive from the course staff, you will revise your preliminary project plan, creating a more detailed plan to implement your new feature. The project plan will include: . | Revised user stories and conditions of satisfaction (based on feedback on the preliminary project plan) | Revised work breakdown (based on feedback on the preliminary project plan) | . Your team will self-organize, as agile teams do, and will use the work breakdown and schedule as the basis for weekly check-ins with your team’s TA. Software Development Process . Each team is expected to use of a structured development process, including use of pull requests and code reviews for their regular github commits. You will also need to ensure appropriate division of labor within the project (i.e., roughly equal). Teams will also be expected to complete regular progress reports (or sprint retrospectives), and provide honest feedback as part of individual/team surveys. Peer evaluations will also be used (for Week 6, 8, 10-14). Please note that one of the most important factors in successfully completing a team project is having open, honest and effective communication between all team members as well as stakeholders. Project Implementation and Documentation . Your final team deliverable will be a “release” of your new feature on GitHub (with tests), and will be accompanied by a demo. Your final team deliverable will include: . | The implementation of your new features | Automated tests for your new features | deployment of your application | A Final Report | A Poster &amp; Demo (each instructor will provide specifics of the demo, which might vary for each section) | . Accompanying the final team deliverable will be an individual reflection, which every student must submit on their own, which will include your reflections on: . | The evolution of your project concept: How does the project that you delivered compare to what you originally planned to deliver? What caused these deviations? | The software engineering processes that you feel could have been improved in your project: were there any procesess that in hindsight, you wish that you followed, or wish that you followed better? | Your team dynamic: Provide a frank (and ideally, blameless) postmortem of your and your teammates collaborative performance and participation. If you had to do this same project over with the same teammates, what would you have done differently (or not) to improve your team’s overall performance? | . The details for the final project deliverable and associated rubrics will be released by Week 10. ",

    "doc": "Code Style",
    "title": "Code Style",
    "content": "Programs are easier to read and to understand when they are written in a familiar style and follow standard coding conventions. Most organizations that develop software therefore require programmers to write programs that follow the organization’s preferred style and coding conventions. These conventions can be very elaborate. Many of the guidelines are, in fact, arbitrary. When you are working on a coding project with other developers, different developers often have preference for slightly different syntax, for instance: should our string literals be enclosed by single quotes (') or double quotes (\")? Should files be indented with spaces or tabs? In TypeScript, there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same goal, for instance, you could create a new empty array with the expression const myArray = new Array(), or const myArray = []. Sometimes there is no difference between these variants except for how it reads, and other times there may be unintended consequences of making the seemingly correct but subtly wrong choice. Thankfully, it is possible to write automated checkers (and, at times, fixers) for these style violations. All code that you write for this class will be checked by ESLint, and must be free of style warnings and errors. Our ESlint rules are derived from Airbnb’s JavaScript Style Guide, ESLint’s Recommended Rules, TypeScript/ESLint Recommended Rules, React ESLint Rules and React Hooks ESLint Rules. We do not suggest studying these lists directly, instead, begin writing code naturally, and allow your IDE’s built-in style checker to report issues as you find them. The most important rules to get started are: . | Indent using spaces, not tabs; use 2 spaces for each level of indentation | Enclose all string literals with single quotes, not double | Variables must be named using lowerCamelCase, types are named using UpperCamelCase. Constants (read-only variables that are assigned a static value once and not reused) must be named using UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES. | The maximum line length is 100 characters | . Naming . While the linter can automatically flag names that violate camelCase rules, it can not automatically determine that a name is “good” - this is a subjective judgement call. Please consider the following when choosing names: . | Names should be informative (e.g lineTooLong() rather than checkLineLength()) | Names for types are typically nouns or noun phrases. Interface names, however, might be adjectives (e.g. Serializable). Class names may be noun phrases that include the interface name (e.g. CuckooClock and DigitalClock for classes that implement the interface Clock). | Use noun-like names for functions or methods that return values (e.g. circleDiameter rather than calculateDiameter). (Exception: simple getters can still have names that begin with get). | Reserve verb-like names for functions that perform actions (e.g. addItem). | Use adjective phrases for predicates when possible (e.g. line.tooLong()) | Variable and property names should be descriptive of what the variable is for, and not be named after the type of the variable (which is captured in the variable’s type declaration) | Names for properties that are private must start with a _ | . Documentation and Comments . All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) must be documented using JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does. Example: . /** The unique identifier for this player * */ private readonly _id: string; . /** * A handler to process a remote player's subscription to updates for a room * * @param socket the Socket object that we will use to communicate with the player */ . Consider adding comments within your code to describe non-obvious behavior, or to capture why the code is written the way that it is. Do not add comments that simply restate what can already be immediately discerned by reading the code. For example, here is a useful comment: . // No valid session exists for this token, hence this client's connection should be terminated socket.disconnect(true); return; . Here is a useless comment on the same code snippet: . // Disconnect the socket socket.disconnect(true); return; . Comments are for documentation, not for keeping track of old code you are no longer using (do not submit commented-out code). ",
