On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/staff) (all 3 instructors and 20 TAs), welcome to the Fall 2025 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/225864) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material from the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the calendars for each section, the first two lectures (with related activities), and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, Unit testing with Jest, MongoDB and API Requests.

The first [individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/assignments/ip1) is now available. This deliverable is due by Wednesday September 17th at 12pm (Noon) ET. Your work will be submitted through github Classroom. We would encourage you to start working on this assignment early. Feel free to use piazza to ask questions and use office hours if you need help. We have 80 hours of scheduled TA office hours per week. The schedule of office hours is posted on the staff page. We will start holding office hours from Thursday Sep 4th. 

Zoom link for the online section (Section 9) can be found on Canvas -> Zoom Meetings.

We are excited to meet you all next week!
