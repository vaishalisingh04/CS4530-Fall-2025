On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/staff) (all 3 instructors and 20 TAs), welcome to the Fall 2025 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2025/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/225864) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material from the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the calendars for each section, the first two lectures (with related activities), and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, Unit testing with Jest, MongoDB and API Requests. 

We are excited to meet you all next week!
